# Foliorank

## Project Overview

Foliorank is a simulation-first, AI-assisted portfolio research framework designed for educational and analytical purposes. The framework enables the systematic exploration of portfolio construction methodologies through deterministic simulations, with a focus on transparency and behavioral constraints.

The framework processes natural language descriptions and converts them into structured portfolio specifications for simulation and analysis. All operations occur within a controlled simulation environment, with no connection to external financial systems or real-world execution.

## Core Principles

- **Simulation-only**: All operations are contained within a simulation environment
- **Deterministic & reproducible**: Analysis results can be consistently reproduced given the same inputs
- **Transparent decision processes**: Framework decisions and transformations are documented and auditable
- **Safety-first AI behavior**: AI components operate under strict behavioral constraints designed to prevent unintended actions

## What Foliorank Is

- Portfolio construction and comparison framework
- Research and learning tool for portfolio analysis
- Strategy simulation environment
- Open-source SDK for portfolio research

## What Foliorank Is NOT

- Not a trading platform
- Not an execution engine
- Not an investment advisor
- Not a broker or exchange
- Does not provide financial advice

## Simulation-Only Disclaimer

Foliorank operates exclusively within simulation environments and does not execute any real-world transactions. The framework is designed for research, education, and analytical purposes only. No recommendations, guarantees, or advice are provided. Users are responsible for their own decisions and actions.

## High-Level Architecture

The framework consists of two main components:

- **SDK (open-source, simulation-only)**: Core simulation and analysis functionality
- **Cloud services (future, optional, separate)**: Extended capabilities for larger-scale simulations

The SDK provides the primary interface for portfolio research and maintains strict separation between simulation logic and any potential future services.

## Project Status

This is an early-stage project with a documentation-first approach. APIs and interfaces may evolve as the project develops. The current focus is on establishing robust simulation foundations and clear behavioral constraints.
